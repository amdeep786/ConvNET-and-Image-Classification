# ConvNET-and-Image-Classification

In this work, a Convolutional Neural Network ('ConvNet' or 'CNN') has been created for classifying 10 plant species by images of their flowers. In detail, the following steps have been performed in the course:

1. Exploration and Preprocessing of the data
2. Build a ConvNet from scratch
3. Evaluation of training and validation accuracy
4. Addition of regularization techniques
